## It is very hard to understand what is 'Groups creation domain' under article's subdirectory

## Suggestion to add a function is let the participant to make some ink note during their conferencing bridge

for my use experience, I always use a open source software: gink to make my presentation more impressive, but this is nor native under a Teams meeting. Then I think this is good consider to make it true. 

Teams Meeting当中无法像腾讯会议那样可以做批注

## Durning the Teams meeting, when I click the button of 'copy join info' under meeting info, it copys a lots of meetinfg infomaiton but not a meeting link.

Because we are always use social app for the communication, always spread the meeting link via those apps, but if we use copy join info for this propose, it will stuck for me. I sugggest add more button such as copy meeting link to let people more clear to take their action, when copy join info, and when copy meeting link....

## The meeting link is too long, making it inconvenient to use social media to distribute meeting information

The meeting link is too long, making it inconvenient to use social media to distribute meeting information, and it is recommended that it can be designed with a conference access number

## Durning the Teams Meeting, there is call health function under the drop down menu, suggest to make it pop up

The Call health feature suggests that a separate window can be used by meeting support personnel to view the situation in real time on another monitor

## Suggest to make the "lock the meeting" more easy to use and easy to find

Why does the ability to lock a meeting appear in the participant list, I recommend putting it in the Leave button with the end of the meeting, or some other better location

Also, lock the meeting is difficult is find out, there need to four clicks to make the meeting lock.

Click 'show participant', then click 'more actiion', then click 'lock the meeting', then click 'lock'

## Suggest to add the dial plan policy to policy pack

Under Teams TAC, there is no dial plan in the policy pack, and the voice routing policy and dial plan are used at the same time in the actual application

## Suggest to make more speed up for MS Whiteboard on China

Teams Meeting is based on Microsoft Whiteboard as its whiteboard sharing, which is very slow compared to China domestic users, and relative to the whiteboard sharing of other big manufacturers, this function iteration is relatively slow.

Teams Meeting是沿用Microsoft Whiteboard作为它的白板共享的，相对于国内用户来说速度非常的慢，相对于其它大厂的白板共享来说，功能迭代又是相对地慢。
